# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
The Plant Disease Detection project leverages the power of machine learning to identify and classify plant diseases from images. The goal is to provide farmers and agricultural professionals with a tool that can quickly and accurately diagnose plant diseases, facilitating early intervention and reducing crop losses.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify plant images into healthy or diseased categories.
- **Disease Identification**: Identifies various types of diseases affecting different plant species.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple interface for uploading images and receiving disease diagnoses.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high accuracy through a well-trained model using a large dataset of plant images.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of new plant species and diseases as needed.

## Project Structure
- **Dataset**: Contains images of healthy and diseased plants, categorized by species and disease type.
- **Model**: Includes the code for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
